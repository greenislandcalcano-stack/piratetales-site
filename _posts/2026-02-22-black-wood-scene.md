description: A behind-the-scenes look at how the Pirate Tales universe was created, from maps and lore to characters like Sebas, Rufo, and Lulue.

Every world begins with a question.

Mine was simple:

“What happens after the pirate legends end?”

Not the glory.

Not the treasure.

But the survivors.

The tired ones.

The ones who carry ghosts.

Pirate Tales grew from notebooks filled with:
- broken maps
- whispered prophecies
- colonial politics
- strange wood that shouldn’t float
- characters who refuse to behave like heroes

Sebas was born from silence.

Rufo from laughter in gunpowder smoke.

Lulue from charm hiding something dangerous.

Little by little, the ocean appeared.

And once the sea exists…

Stories sail on their own.
