In most pirate stories, captains shout.

Caonex whispers.

And somehow the entire deck goes silent.

He is not the strongest man aboard the Black Wood.  
Not the fastest with a blade.  
Not even the most feared.

But he is the one everyone watches.

Because when Caonex makes a decision… ships burn.

Raised between colonial courts and salt-stained docks, he learned early that survival isn’t about honor.

It’s about **leverage**.

Maps that lie.  
Alliances that rot.  
Deals sealed with blood instead of ink.

He negotiates like a priest and fights like a devil.

And every victory costs him something he never gets back.

That is the curse of leadership.

That is Caonex.
