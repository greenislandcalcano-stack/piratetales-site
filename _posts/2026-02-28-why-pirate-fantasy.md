There’s something eternal about pirates.

Maybe it’s the freedom.

Maybe it’s the danger.

Maybe it’s the idea that the map lies and the world is still wild.

Pirates live outside kingdoms.

Outside laws.

Outside destiny.

And fantasy makes that even sharper.

Add:
- haunted seas
- cursed ships
- forbidden islands
- love that survives war

Suddenly the ocean becomes myth.

That’s why Pirate Tales exists.

Not just to tell pirate stories.

But to ask what happens when legends refuse to die.
