Pirate Tales may be fantasy.

But its bones are real.

The Caribbean once burned with privateers, smugglers, and naval wars.

Spanish galleons carried gold.  
French governors plotted in candlelit courts.  
British cannons decided who owned entire islands.

Men vanished at sea and were written off as “storms.”

But storms weren’t always the reason.

Some islands truly were erased from maps.

Some captains truly betrayed their own crews.

And some treasures were never recovered.

Pirate Tales takes those forgotten fragments of history and asks:

**What if the legends were true?**

What if cursed wood existed?  
What if witches guarded the fog?  
What if the sea remembered every oath ever broken?

That is where fantasy begins.
