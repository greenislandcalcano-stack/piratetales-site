title: "Canto II — Of Empires, Fog, and Forgotten Islands"
description: The historical and mythical roots of Pirate Tales, where Caribbean wars, vanished ships, and cursed waters blur the line between truth and legend.

Before the legends,

there were ledgers.

Before the myths,

there were taxes.

Empires are not born from glory—

but from ink.

From signatures.
From treaties.
From men deciding, on paper,
who owns the sea.

---

The Caribbean burned long before our story began.

Spanish gold crossing black water.
French courts whispering betrayal.
British cannons baptizing entire ports in smoke.

Ships vanished.

Not sunk.

Vanished.

Erased from maps
as if the ocean had swallowed their names.

And the priests called it weather.

And the admirals called it war.

But sailors knew better.

Sailors always know better.

They know the sea keeps secrets.

They know some islands refuse visitors.

They know the fog sometimes watches back.

---

Pirate Tales was born there—

between fact and rumor.

Between history and nightmare.

For what is fantasy,

if not history we are afraid to admit?

Perhaps the witches existed.

Perhaps the cursed wood floated.

Perhaps the dead truly waited on those shores.

Or perhaps—

men simply needed monsters

to explain their own cruelty.
